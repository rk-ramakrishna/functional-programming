* [Programming Paradigms](#programming-paradigms)


## Programming Paradigms:

1. Different people think in different ways to solve the problem. 

2. Twins who born in seconds of difference also think in different dimensions to tackle simple to complex problems 

3. To solve problems, different languages provided various programming approaches

4. These programming approaches called as Paradigms

5. **Do you solve problems by just jumping in,** willing to ignore the experience and wisdom of those that may have programmed solutions to problems very similar to yours? 
   We learn from the past. Our ancestors discovered and invented ways of programming that we know call paradigms. We benefit from the knowledge they left us, even as we strive to create new paradigms ourselves. 
   
6. A programming paradigm is a style, or “way,” of programming.

7. Some languages make it easy to write in some paradigms but not others.

8. Few common paradigms

    *  **Imperative:** Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.
	
	*  **Declarative:** Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.
	
	*  **Structured:** Programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures.

	*  **Procedural:** Imperative programming with procedure calls.

	*  **Functional (Applicative):** Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.

	*  **Function-Level (Combinator):** Programming with no variables at all.

	*  **Object-Oriented:** Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other. Objects have their own internal (encapsulated) state and public interfaces. 
	   Object  orientation can be:

	*  **Class-based:** Objects get state and behavior based on membership in a class.

	*  **Prototype-based:** Objects get behavior from a prototype object.
	
    *  **Event-Driven:** Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.

	*  **Flow-Driven:** Programming processes communicating with each other over predefined channels.

	*  **Logic (Rule-based):** Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules. An engine infers the answers to questions.

	*  **Constraint:** Programming by specifying a set of constraints. An engine finds the values that meet the constraints.

	*  **Aspect-Oriented:** Programming cross-cutting concerns applied transparently.

	*  **Reflective:** Programming by manipulating the program elements themselves.

	*  **Array:** Programming with powerful array operators that usually make loops unnecessary.



**Note:  A single program can feature multiple paradigms!**
